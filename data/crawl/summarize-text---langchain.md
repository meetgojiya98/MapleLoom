# Summarize Text | ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain

Suppose you have a set of documents (PDFs, Notion pages, customer questions, etc.) and you want to summarize the content.
LLMs are a great tool for this given their proficiency in understanding and synthesizing text.
In the context of
retrieval-augmented generation
, summarizing text can help distill the information in a large number of retrieved documents to provide context for a LLM.
In this walkthrough we'll go over how to summarize content from multiple documents using LLMs.
Concepts
‚Äã
Concepts we will cover are:
Using
language models
.
Using
document loaders
, specifically the
WebBaseLoader
to load content from an HTML webpage.
Two ways to summarize or otherwise combine documents.
Stuff
, which simply concatenates documents into a prompt;
Map-reduce
, for larger sets of documents. This splits documents into batches, summarizes those, and then summarizes the summaries.
Shorter, targeted guides on these strategies and others, including
iterative refinement
, can be found in the
how-to guides
.
Setup
‚Äã
Jupyter Notebook
‚Äã
This guide (and most of the other guides in the documentation) uses
Jupyter notebooks
and assumes the reader is as well. Jupyter notebooks are perfect for learning how to work with LLM systems because oftentimes things can go wrong (unexpected output, API down, etc) and going through guides in an interactive environment is a great way to better understand them.
This and other tutorials are perhaps most conveniently run in a Jupyter notebook. See
here
for instructions on how to install.
Installation
‚Äã
To install LangChain run:
conda install langchain -c conda-forge
For more details, see our
Installation guide
.
LangSmith
‚Äã
Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.
As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.
The best way to do this is with
LangSmith
.
After you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:
export LANGSMITH_TRACING="true"
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY="..."
Or, if in a notebook, you can set them with:
import
getpass
import
os
os
.
environ
[
"LANGSMITH_TRACING"
]
=
"true"
os
.
environ
[
"LANGSMITH_API_KEY"
]
=
getpass
.
getpass
(
)
Overview
‚Äã
A central question for building a summarizer is how to pass your documents into the LLM's context window. Two common approaches for this are:
Stuff
: Simply "stuff" all your documents into a single prompt. This is the simplest approach (see
here
for more on the
create_stuff_documents_chain
constructor, which is used for this method).
Map-reduce
: Summarize each document on its own in a "map" step and then "reduce" the summaries into a final summary (see
here
for more on the
MapReduceDocumentsChain
, which is used for this method).
Note that map-reduce is especially effective when understanding of a sub-document does not rely on preceding context. For example, when summarizing a corpus of many, shorter documents. In other cases, such as summarizing a novel or body of text with an inherent sequence,
iterative refinement
may be more effective.
Setup
‚Äã
First set environment variables and install packages:
%
pip install
-
-
upgrade
-
-
quiet tiktoken langchain langgraph beautifulsoup4 langchain
-
community
import
os
os
.
environ
[
"LANGSMITH_TRACING"
]
=
"true"
First we load in our documents. We will use
WebBaseLoader
to load a blog post:
from
langchain_community
.
document_loaders
import
WebBaseLoader
loader
=
WebBaseLoader
(
"https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/"
)
docs
=
loader
.
load
(
)
Let's next select a LLM:
pip install -qU "langchain[google-genai]"
import
getpass
import
os
if
not
os
.
environ
.
get
(
"GOOGLE_API_KEY"
)
:
os
.
environ
[
"GOOGLE_API_KEY"
]
=
getpass
.
getpass
(
"Enter API key for Google Gemini: "
)
from
langchain
.
chat_models
import
init_chat_model
llm
=
init_chat_model
(
"gemini-2.5-flash"
,
model_provider
=
"google_genai"
)
Stuff: summarize in a single LLM call
‚Äã
We can use
create_stuff_documents_chain
, especially if using larger context window models such as:
128k token OpenAI
gpt-4o
200k token Anthropic
claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620
The chain will take a list of documents, insert them all into a prompt, and pass that prompt to an LLM:
from
langchain
.

.
combine_documents
import
create_stuff_documents_chain
from
langchain

import

prompt

)
]
)
chain

)
result
=
chain
.
invoke
(

}
)
print
(

)
The article "LLM Powered Autonomous Agents" by Lilian Weng discusses the development and capabilities of autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs). It outlines a system architecture that includes three main components: Planning, Memory, and Tool Use.
1. **Planning** involves task decomposition, where complex tasks are broken down into manageable subgoals, and self-reflection, allowing agents to learn from past actions to improve future performance. Techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts (ToT) are highlighted for enhancing reasoning and planning.
2. **Memory** is categorized into short-term and long-term memory, with mechanisms for fast retrieval using Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) algorithms. This allows agents to retain and recall information effectively.
3. **Tool Use** enables agents to interact with external APIs and tools, enhancing their capabilities beyond the limitations of their training data. Examples include MRKL systems and frameworks like HuggingGPT, which facilitate task planning and execution.
The article also addresses challenges such as finite context length, difficulties in long-term planning, and the reliability of natural language interfaces. It concludes with case studies demonstrating the practical applications of these concepts in scientific discovery and interactive simulations. Overall, the article emphasizes the potential of LLMs as powerful problem solvers in autonomous agent systems.
Streaming
‚Äã
Note that we can also stream the result token-by-token:

in
chain
.
stream
(
{

}
)
:
print
(

You can easily customize the prompt.
You can easily try different LLMs, (e.g.,
Claude
) via the
llm
parameter.
Map-Reduce: summarize long texts via parallelization
‚Äã
Let's unpack the map reduce approach. For this, we'll first map each document to an individual summary using an LLM. Then we'll reduce or consolidate those summaries into a single global summary.
Note that the map step is typically parallelized over the input documents.
LangGraph
, built on top of
langchain-core
, supports
map-reduce
workflows and is well-suited to this problem:
LangGraph allows for individual steps (such as successive summarizations) to be streamed, allowing for greater control of execution;
LangGraph's
checkpointing
supports error recovery, extending with human-in-the-loop workflows, and easier incorporation into conversational applications.
The LangGraph implementation is straightforward to modify and extend, as we will see below.
Map
‚Äã
Let's first define the prompt associated with the map step. We can use the same summarization prompt as in the
stuff
approach, above:
from
langchain_core
.
prompts
import
ChatPromptTemplate
map_prompt
=
ChatPromptTemplate
.
from_messages
(
[
(
"system"
,
"Write a concise summary of the following:\\n\\n{context}"
)
]
)
We can also use the Prompt Hub to store and fetch prompts.
This will work with your
LangSmith API key
.
For example, see the map prompt
here
.
from
langchain
import
hub
map_prompt
=
hub
.
pull
(
"rlm/map-prompt"
)
Reduce
‚Äã
We also define a prompt that takes the document mapping results and reduces them into a single output.
reduce_template
=
"""
The following is a set of summaries:
{docs}
Take these and distill it into a final, consolidated summary
of the main themes.
"""
reduce_prompt
=
ChatPromptTemplate
(
[
(
"human"
,
reduce_template
)
]
)
Orchestration via LangGraph
‚Äã
Below we implement a simple application that maps the summarization step on a list of documents, then reduces them using the above prompts.
Map-reduce flows are particularly useful when texts are long compared to the context window of a LLM. For long texts, we need a mechanism that ensures that the context to be summarized in the reduce step does not exceed a model's context window size. Here we implement a recursive "collapsing" of the summaries: the inputs are partitioned based on a token limit, and summaries are generated of the partitions. This step is repeated until the total length of the summaries is within a desired limit, allowing for the summarization of arbitrary-length text.
First we chunk the blog post into smaller "sub documents" to be mapped:
from
langchain_text_splitters
import
CharacterTextSplitter
text_splitter
=
CharacterTextSplitter
.
from_tiktoken_encoder
(
chunk_size
=
1000
,
chunk_overlap
=
0
)
split_docs
=
text_splitter
.
split_documents
(
docs
)
print
(
f"Generated
{
len
(
split_docs
)
}
documents."
)
Created a chunk of size 1003, which is longer than the specified 1000
``````output
Generated 14 documents.
Next, we define our graph. Note that we define an artificially low maximum token length of 1,000 tokens to illustrate the "collapsing" step.

When running the application, we can stream the graph to observe its sequence of steps. Below, we will simply print out the name of the step.
Note that because we have a loop in the graph, it can be helpful to specify a
recursion_limit
on its execution. This will raise a specific error when the specified limit is exceeded.
