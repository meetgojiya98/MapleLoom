# Qdrant Web UI - Qdrant

Qdrant Web UI
You can manage both local and cloud Qdrant deployments through the Web UI.
If you’ve set up a deployment locally with the Qdrant
Quickstart
,
navigate to http://localhost:6333/dashboard.
If you’ve set up a deployment in a cloud cluster, find your Cluster URL in your
cloud dashboard, at
https://cloud.qdrant.io
. Add
:6333/dashboard
to the end
of the URL.
Access the Web UI
Qdrant’s Web UI is an intuitive and efficient graphic interface for your Qdrant Collections, REST API and data points.
In the
Console
, you may use the REST API to interact with Qdrant, while in
Collections
, you can manage all the collections and upload Snapshots.
Qdrant Web UI features
In the Qdrant Web UI, you can:
Run HTTP-based calls from the console
List and search existing
collections
Learn from our interactive tutorial
You can navigate to these options directly. For example, if you used our

you can review our tutorial at http://localhost:6333/dashboard#/tutorial.
