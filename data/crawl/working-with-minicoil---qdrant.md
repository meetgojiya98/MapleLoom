# Working with miniCOIL - Qdrant

How to use miniCOIL, Qdrant’s Sparse Neural Retriever
miniCOIL
is an open-sourced sparse neural retrieval model that acts as if a BM25-based retriever understood the contextual meaning of keywords and ranked results accordingly.
miniCOIL
scoring is based on the BM25 formula scaled by the semantic similarity between matched keywords in a query and a document.
$$
\text{miniCOIL}(D,Q) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{IDF}(q_i) \cdot \text{Importance}^{q_i}_{D} \cdot {\color{YellowGreen}\text{Meaning}^{q_i \times d_j}} \text{, where keyword } d_j \in D \text{ equals } q_i
$$
A detailed breakdown of the idea behind miniCOIL can be found in the
“miniCOIL: on the road to Usable Sparse Neural Retreival” article
or, in a
recorded talk “miniCOIL: Sparse Neural Retrieval Done Right”
.
This tutorial will demonstrate how miniCOIL-based sparse neural retrieval performs compared to BM25-based lexical retrieval.
When to use miniCOIL
When exact keyword matches in the retrieved results are a requirement, and all matches should be ranked based on the contextual meaning of keywords.
If results should be similar by meaning but are expressed differently, with no overlapping keywords, you should use dense embeddings or combine them with miniCOIL in a hybrid search setting.
Setup
Install
qdrant-client
integration with
fastembed
.
pip
install
"qdrant-client[fastembed]"
Then, initialize the Qdrant client. You could use for experiments
a free cluster
in Qdrant Cloud or run a
local Qdrant instance via Docker
.
We’ll run our search on a list of book and article titles containing the keywords “
vector
” and “
search
” used in different contexts, to demonstrate how miniCOIL captures the meaning of these keywords as opposed to BM25.

Create Collection
Let’s create a collection to store and index titles.
As miniCOIL was designed with Qdrant’s ability to calculate the keywords Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) in mind, we need to configure miniCOIL sparse vectors with
IDF modifier
.
Don't forget to configure the IDF modifier to use miniCOIL sparse vectors in Qdrant!
client
.
create_collection
(
collection_name
=
"
{minicoil_collection_name}
"
,
sparse_vectors_config
=
{
"minicoil"
:
models
.
SparseVectorParams
(
modifier
=
models
.
Modifier
.
IDF
#Inverse Document Frequency
)
}
)
Analogously, we configure a collection with BM25-based sparse vectors
client
.
create_collection
(
collection_name
=
"
{bm25_collection_name}
"
,
sparse_vectors_config
=
{
"bm25"
:
models
.
SparseVectorParams
(
modifier
=
models
.
Modifier
.
IDF
)
}
)
Convert to Sparse Vectors & Upload to Qdrant
Next, we need to convert titles to miniCOIL sparse representations and upsert them into the configured collection.
Qdrant and FastEmbed integration allows for hiding the inference process under the hood.
That means:
FastEmbed downloads the selected model from Hugging Face;
FastEmbed runs local inference under the hood;
Inferenced sparse representations are uploaded to Qdrant.

Retrieve with miniCOIL
Using query
“Vectors in Medicine”
, we’ll demo the difference between miniCOIL and BM25-based retrieval.
None of the indexed titles contain the keyword
“medicine”
, so it won’t contribute to the similarity score.
At the same time, the word
“vector”
appears once in many titles, and its role is roughly equal in all of them from the perspective of the BM25-based retriever.
miniCOIL, however, can capture the meaning of the keyword
“vector”
in the context of
“medicine”
and match a document where
“vector”
is used in a medicine-related context.
For BM25-based retrieval:
query
=
"Vectors in Medicine"
client
.
query_points
(
collection_name
=
"
{bm25_collection_name}
"
,
query
=
models
.
Document
(
text
=
query
,
model
=
"Qdrant/bm25"
),
using
=
"bm25"
,
limit
=
1
,
)
Result will be:
QueryResponse
(
points
=[
ScoredPoint
(
id
=
18,
version
=
1,
score
=
0.8405092,
payload
={
'title'
:
'Advanced Vector Calculus for Engineers'
}
,
vector
=
None,
shard_key
=
None,
order_value
=
None
)
]
)
While for miniCOIL-based retrieval:
query
=
"Vectors in Medicine"
client
.
query_points
(
collection_name
=
"
{minicoil_collection_name}
"
,
query
=
models
.
Document
(
text
=
query
,
model
=
"Qdrant/minicoil-v1"
),
using
=
"minicoil"
,
limit
=
1
)
We will get:
QueryResponse
(
points
=[
ScoredPoint
(
id
=
28,
version
=
1,
score
=
0.7005557,
payload
={
'title'
:
'Vector Control Strategies in Public Health'
}
,
vector
=
None,
shard_key
=
None,
order_value
=
None
)
]
)
