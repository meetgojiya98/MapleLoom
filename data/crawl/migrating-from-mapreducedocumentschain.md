# Migrating from MapReduceDocumentsChain

Migrating from MapReduceDocumentsChain
MapReduceDocumentsChain
implements a map-reduce strategy over (potentially long) texts. The strategy is as follows:
Split a text into smaller documents;
Map a process onto the smaller documents;
Reduce or consolidate the results of the process into a final result.
Note that the map step is typically parallelized over the input documents.
A common process applied in this context is summarization, in which the map step summarizes individual documents, and the reduce step generates a summary of the summaries.
In the reduce step,
MapReduceDocumentsChain
supports a recursive "collapsing" of the summaries: the inputs would be partitioned based on a token limit, and summaries would be generated of the partitions. This step would be repeated until the total length of the summaries was within a desired limit, allowing for the summarization of arbitrary-length text. This is particularly useful for models with smaller context windows.
LangGraph supports
map-reduce
workflows, and confers a number of advantages for this problem:
LangGraph allows for individual steps (such as successive summarizations) to be streamed, allowing for greater control of execution;
LangGraph's
checkpointing
supports error recovery, extending with human-in-the-loop workflows, and easier incorporation into conversational applications.
The LangGraph implementation is easier to extend, as we will see below.
Below we will go through both
MapReduceDocumentsChain
and a corresponding LangGraph implementation, first on a simple example for illustrative purposes, and second on a longer example text to demonstrate the recursive reduce step.
Let's first load a chat model:
pip install -qU "langchain[google-genai]"

get
(
"GOOGLE_API_KEY"
)

[

getpass
(
"Enter API key for Google Gemini: "
)
from
langchain

Fruits come in a variety of colors, with apples being red, blueberries being blue, and bananas being yellow.
In the
LangSmith trace
we observe four LLM calls: one summarizing each of the three input documents, and one summarizing the summaries.
LangGraph
​
Below we show a LangGraph implementation, using the same prompt templates as above. The graph includes a node for generating summaries which is mapped across a list of input documents. This node then flows to a second node that generates the final summary.

In the
LangSmith trace
we recover the same four LLM calls as before.
Summarizing long documents
​
Map-reduce flows are particularly useful when texts are long compared to the context window of a LLM.
MapReduceDocumentsChain
supports a recursive "collapsing" of the summaries: the inputs are partitioned based on a token limit, and summaries are generated of the partitions. This step is repeated until the total length of the summaries is within a desired limit, allowing for the summarization of arbitrary-length text.
This "collapse" step is implemented as a
while
loop within
MapReduceDocumentsChain
. We can demonstrate this step on a longer text, a
LLM Powered Autonomous Agents
blog post by Lilian Weng (as featured in the
RAG tutorial
and other documentation).
First we load the post and chunk it into smaller "sub documents":

​
Details
We can invoke
MapReduceDocumentsChain
as before:
result
=
map_reduce_chain
.
invoke
(
split_docs
)
print
(
result
[
"output_text"
]
)
The article discusses the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to power autonomous agents in various tasks, showcasing their capabilities in problem-solving beyond generating written content. Key components such as planning, memory optimization, and tool use are explored, with proof-of-concept demos like AutoGPT and GPT-Engineer demonstrating the potential of LLM-powered agents. Challenges include limitations in historical information retention and natural language interface reliability, while the potential of LLMs in enhancing reasoning, problem-solving, and planning proficiency for autonomous agents is highlighted. Overall, the article emphasizes the versatility and power of LLMs in creating intelligent agents for tasks like scientific discovery and experiment design.
Consider the
LangSmith trace
for the above invocation. When instantiating our
ReduceDocumentsChain
, we set a
token_max
of 1,000 tokens. This results in a total of 17 LLM calls:
14 calls are for summarizing the 14 sub-documents generated by our text splitter.
This generated summaries that totaled about 1,000 - 2,000 tokens. Because we set a
token_max
of 1,000, there are two more calls to summarize (or "collapse") these summaries.
One final call is for generating a final summary of the two "collapsed" summaries.
LangGraph
​
Details
We can extend our original map-reduce implementation in LangGraph to implement the same recursive collapsing step. We make the following changes:
Add a
collapsed_summaries
key to the state to store the collapsed summaries;
Update the final summarization node to summarize the collapsed summaries;
Add a
collapse_summaries
node that partitions a list of documents based on a token length (1,000 tokens here, as before) and generates summaries of each partition and stores the result in
collapsed_summaries
.
We add a conditional edge from
collapse_summaries
to itself to form a loop: if the collapsed summaries total more than the
token_max
, we re-run the node.

As before, we can stream the graph to observe its sequence of steps. Below, we will simply print out the name of the step.
Note that because we have a loop in the graph, it can be helpful to specify a
recursion_limit
on its execution. This is analogous to
ReduceDocumentsChain.token_max
to will raise a specific error when the specified limit is exceeded.

In the corresponding

we can see the same 17 LLM calls as before, this time grouped under their respective nodes.
