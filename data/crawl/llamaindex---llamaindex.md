Introduction
What are agents?
Agents
are LLM-powered knowledge assistants that use tools to perform tasks like research, data extraction, and more. Agents range from simple question-answering to being able to sense, decide and take actions in order to complete tasks.
LlamaIndex provides a framework for building agents including the ability to use RAG pipelines as one of many tools to complete a task.
What are workflows?
Workflows
are multi-step processes that combine one or more agents, data connectors, and other tools to complete a task. They are event-driven software that allows you to combine RAG data sources and multiple agents to create a complex application that can perform a wide variety of tasks with reflection, error-correction, and other hallmarks of advanced LLM applications. You can then
deploy these agentic workflows
as production microservices.
What is context augmentation?
LLMs offer a natural language interface between humans and data. LLMs come pre-trained on huge amounts of publicly available data, but they are not trained on
your
data. Your data may be private or specific to the problem you're trying to solve. It's behind APIs, in SQL databases, or trapped in PDFs and slide decks.
Context augmentation makes your data available to the LLM to solve the problem at hand. LlamaIndex provides the tools to build any of context-augmentation use case, from prototype to production. Our tools allow you to ingest, parse, index and process your data and quickly implement complex query workflows combining data access with LLM prompting.
The most popular example of context-augmentation is
Retrieval-Augmented Generation or RAG
, which combines context with LLMs at inference time.
LlamaIndex is the framework for Context-Augmented LLM Applications
LlamaIndex imposes no restriction on how you use LLMs. You can use LLMs as auto-complete, chatbots, agents, and more. It just makes using them easier. We provide tools like:
Data connectors
ingest your existing data from their native source and format. These could be APIs, PDFs, SQL, and (much) more.
Data indexes
structure your data in intermediate representations that are easy and performant for LLMs to consume.
Engines
provide natural language access to your data. For example:
Query engines are powerful interfaces for question-answering (e.g. a RAG flow).
Chat engines are conversational interfaces for multi-message, "back and forth" interactions with your data.
Agents
are LLM-powered knowledge workers augmented by tools, from simple helper functions to API integrations and more.
Observability/Evaluation
integrations that enable you to rigorously experiment, evaluate, and monitor your app in a virtuous cycle.
Workflows
allow you to combine all of the above into an event-driven system far more flexible than other, graph-based approaches.
Use cases

üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Who is LlamaIndex for?
LlamaIndex provides tools for beginners, advanced users, and everyone in between.
Our high-level API allows beginner users to use LlamaIndex to ingest and query their data in 5 lines of code.
For more complex applications, our lower-level APIs allow advanced users to customize and extend any module -- data connectors, indices, retrievers, query engines, and reranking modules -- to fit their needs.
Getting Started
LlamaIndex is available in Python (these docs) and
Typescript
. If you're not sure where to start, we recommend reading
how to read these docs
which will point you to the right place based on your experience level.
30 second quickstart
Set an environment variable called
OPENAI_API_KEY
with an
OpenAI API key
. Install the Python library:
Put some documents in a folder called
data
, then ask questions about them with our famous 5-line starter:
from
llama_index.core
import
VectorStoreIndex
,
SimpleDirectoryReader
documents
=
SimpleDirectoryReader
(
"data"
)
.
load_data
()
index
=
VectorStoreIndex
.
from_documents
(
documents
)
query_engine
=
index
.
as_query_engine
()
response
=
query_engine
.
query
(
"Some question about the data should go here"
)
print
(
response
)

remote APIs like OpenAI
or
any model that runs on your laptop
