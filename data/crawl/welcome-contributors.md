ðŸ’­ Forum
â€‹
We have a
LangChain Forum
where users can ask usage questions, discuss design decisions, and propose new features.
If you are able to help answer questions, please do so! This will allow the maintainers to spend more time focused on development and bug fixing.
ðŸš© GitHub Issues
â€‹
Our
issues
page is kept up to date with bugs, docs improvements, and triaged feature requests that are being worked on.
There is a
taxonomy of labels
to help with sorting and discovery of issues of interest. Please use these to help
organize issues. Check out the
Help Wanted
and
Good First Issue
tags for recommendations.
If you start working on an issue, please assign it to yourself.
If you are adding an issue, please try to keep it focused on a single, modular bug/improvement/feature.
If two issues are related, or blocking, please link them rather than combining them.
We will try to keep these issues as up-to-date as possible, though
with the rapid rate of development in this field some may get out of date.
If you notice this happening, please let us know.
We have a
community slack
where you can ask questions, get help, and discuss the project with other contributors and users.
ðŸ™‹ Getting Help
â€‹
Our goal is to have the simplest developer setup possible. Should you experience any difficulty getting setup, please
ask in
community slack
or open a
forum post
.
In a similar vein, we do enforce certain linting, formatting, and documentation standards in the codebase.
If you are finding these difficult (or even just annoying) to work with, feel free to ask in
community slack
!
