# How to use few shot examples in chat models

How to use few shot examples in chat models
This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:
This guide covers how to prompt a chat model with example inputs and outputs. Providing the model with a few such examples is called
few-shotting
, and is a simple yet powerful way to guide generation and in some cases drastically improve model performance.
There does not appear to be solid consensus on how best to do few-shot prompting, and the optimal prompt compilation will likely vary by model. Because of this, we provide few-shot prompt templates like the
FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate
as a flexible starting point, and you can modify or replace them as you see fit.
The goal of few-shot prompt templates are to dynamically select examples based on an input, and then format the examples in a final prompt to provide for the model.
Note:
The following code examples are for chat models only, since
FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplates
are designed to output formatted
chat messages
rather than pure strings. For similar few-shot prompt examples for pure string templates compatible with completion models (LLMs), see the
few-shot prompt templates
guide.
Fixed Examples
â€‹
The most basic (and common) few-shot prompting technique is to use fixed prompt examples. This way you can select a chain, evaluate it, and avoid worrying about additional moving parts in production.
The basic components of the template are:
examples
: A list of dictionary examples to include in the final prompt.
example_prompt
: converts each example into 1 or more messages through its
format_messages
method. A common example would be to convert each example into one human message and one AI message response, or a human message followed by a function call message.
Below is a simple demonstration. First, define the examples you'd like to include. Let's give the LLM an unfamiliar mathematical operator, denoted by the "ðŸ¦œ" emoji:
%
pip install
-
qU langchain langchain
-
openai langchain
-
chroma
import
os
from
getpass
import
getpass
if
"OPENAI_API_KEY"
not
in
os
.
environ
:
os
.
environ
[
"OPENAI_API_KEY"
]
=
getpass
(
)
If we try to ask the model what the result of this expression is, it will fail:
from
langchain_openai
import
ChatOpenAI
model
=
ChatOpenAI
(
model
=
"gpt-4o-mini"
,
temperature
=
0.0
)
model
.
invoke
(
"What is 2 ðŸ¦œ 9?"
)
AIMessage(content='The expression "2 ðŸ¦œ 9" is not a standard mathematical operation or equation. It appears to be a combination of the number 2 and the parrot emoji ðŸ¦œ followed by the number 9. It does not have a specific mathematical meaning.', response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 54, 'prompt_tokens': 17, 'total_tokens': 71}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-aad12dda-5c47-4a1e-9949-6fe94e03242a-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 17, 'output_tokens': 54, 'total_tokens': 71})
Now let's see what happens if we give the LLM some examples to work with. We'll define some below:
from
langchain_core
.
prompts
import
ChatPromptTemplate
,
FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate
examples
=
[
{
"input"
:
"2 ðŸ¦œ 2"
,
"output"
:
"4"
}
,
{
"input"
:
"2 ðŸ¦œ 3"
,
"output"
:
"5"
}
,
]
Next, assemble them into the few-shot prompt template.
example_prompt
=
ChatPromptTemplate
.
from_messages
(
[
(
"human"
,
"{input}"
)
,
(
"ai"
,
"{output}"
)
,
]
)
few_shot_prompt
=
FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate
(
example_prompt
=
example_prompt
,
examples
=
examples
,
)
print
(
few_shot_prompt
.
invoke
(
{
}
)
.
to_messages
(
)
)
[HumanMessage(content='2 ðŸ¦œ 2'), AIMessage(content='4'), HumanMessage(content='2 ðŸ¦œ 3'), AIMessage(content='5')]
Finally, we assemble the final prompt as shown below, passing
few_shot_prompt
directly into the
from_messages
factory method, and use it with a model:
final_prompt
=
ChatPromptTemplate
.
from_messages
(
[
(
"system"
,
"You are a wondrous wizard of math."
)
,
few_shot_prompt
,
(
"human"
,
"{input}"
)
,
]
)
And now let's ask the model the initial question and see how it does:
from
langchain_openai
import
ChatOpenAI
chain
=
final_prompt
|
model
chain
.
invoke
(
{
"input"
:
"What is 2 ðŸ¦œ 9?"
}
)
AIMessage(content='11', response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1, 'prompt_tokens': 60, 'total_tokens': 61}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-5ec4e051-262f-408e-ad00-3f2ebeb561c3-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 60, 'output_tokens': 1, 'total_tokens': 61})
And we can see that the model has now inferred that the parrot emoji means addition from the given few-shot examples!
Dynamic few-shot prompting
â€‹
Sometimes you may want to select only a few examples from your overall set to show based on the input. For this, you can replace the
examples
passed into
FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate
with an
example_selector
. The other components remain the same as above! Our dynamic few-shot prompt template would look like:
example_selector
: responsible for selecting few-shot examples (and the order in which they are returned) for a given input. These implement the
BaseExampleSelector
interface. A common example is the vectorstore-backed
SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector
example_prompt
: convert each example into 1 or more messages through its
format_messages
method. A common example would be to convert each example into one human message and one AI message response, or a human message followed by a function call message.
These once again can be composed with other messages and chat templates to assemble your final prompt.
Let's walk through an example with the
SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector
. Since this implementation uses a vectorstore to select examples based on semantic similarity, we will want to first populate the store. Since the basic idea here is that we want to search for and return examples most similar to the text input, we embed the
values
of our prompt examples rather than considering the keys:
from
langchain_chroma
import
Chroma
from
langchain_core
.
example_selectors
import
SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector
from
langchain_openai
import
OpenAIEmbeddings
examples
=
[
{
"input"
:
"2 ðŸ¦œ 2"
,
"output"
:
"4"
}
,
{
"input"
:
"2 ðŸ¦œ 3"
,
"output"
:
"5"
}
,
{
"input"
:
"2 ðŸ¦œ 4"
,
"output"
:
"6"
}
,
{
"input"
:
"What did the cow say to the moon?"
,
"output"
:
"nothing at all"
}
,
{
"input"
:
"Write me a poem about the moon"
,
"output"
:
"One for the moon, and one for me, who are we to talk about the moon?"
,
}
,
]
to_vectorize
=
[
" "
.
join
(
example
.
values
(
)
)
for
example
in
examples
]
embeddings
=
OpenAIEmbeddings
(
)
vectorstore
=
Chroma
.
from_texts
(
to_vectorize
,
embeddings
,
metadatas
=
examples
)
Create the
example_selector
â€‹
With a vectorstore created, we can create the
example_selector
. Here we will call it in isolation, and set
k
on it to only fetch the two example closest to the input.
example_selector
=
SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector
(
vectorstore
=
vectorstore
,
k
=
2
,
)
example_selector
.
select_examples
(
{
"input"
:
"horse"
}
)
[{'input': 'What did the cow say to the moon?', 'output': 'nothing at all'},
{'input': '2 ðŸ¦œ 4', 'output': '6'}]
Create prompt template
â€‹
We now assemble the prompt template, using the
example_selector
created above.
from
langchain_core
.
prompts
import
ChatPromptTemplate
,
FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate
few_shot_prompt
=
FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate
(
input_variables
=
[
"input"
]
,
example_selector
=
example_selector
,
example_prompt
=
ChatPromptTemplate
.
from_messages
(
[
(
"human"
,
"{input}"
)
,
(
"ai"
,
"{output}"
)
]
)
,
)
print
(
few_shot_prompt
.
invoke
(
input
=
"What's 3 ðŸ¦œ 3?"
)
.
to_messages
(
)
)
[HumanMessage(content='2 ðŸ¦œ 3'), AIMessage(content='5'), HumanMessage(content='2 ðŸ¦œ 4'), AIMessage(content='6')]
And we can pass this few-shot chat message prompt template into another chat prompt template:
final_prompt
=
ChatPromptTemplate
.
from_messages
(
[
(
"system"
,
"You are a wondrous wizard of math."
)
,
few_shot_prompt
,
(
"human"
,
"{input}"
)
,
]
)
print
(
few_shot_prompt
.
invoke
(
input
=
"What's 3 ðŸ¦œ 3?"
)
)
messages=[HumanMessage(content='2 ðŸ¦œ 3'), AIMessage(content='5'), HumanMessage(content='2 ðŸ¦œ 4'), AIMessage(content='6')]
Use with an chat model
â€‹
Finally, you can connect your model to the few-shot prompt.
chain
=
final_prompt
|
ChatOpenAI
(
model
=
"gpt-4o-mini"
,
temperature
=
0.0
)
chain
.
invoke
(
{
"input"
:
"What's 3 ðŸ¦œ 3?"
}
)
AIMessage(content='6', response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1, 'prompt_tokens': 60, 'total_tokens': 61}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-d1863e5e-17cd-4e9d-bf7a-b9f118747a65-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 60, 'output_tokens': 1, 'total_tokens': 61})
