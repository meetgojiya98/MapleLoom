# How to retrieve using multiple vectors per document

How to retrieve using multiple vectors per document
It can often be useful to store multiple
vectors
per document. There are multiple use cases where this is beneficial. For example, we can
embed
multiple chunks of a document and associate those embeddings with the parent document, allowing
retriever
hits on the chunks to return the larger document.
LangChain implements a base
MultiVectorRetriever
, which simplifies this process. Much of the complexity lies in how to create the multiple vectors per document. This notebook covers some of the common ways to create those vectors and use the
MultiVectorRetriever
.
The methods to create multiple vectors per document include:
Smaller chunks: split a document into smaller chunks, and embed those (this is
ParentDocumentRetriever
).
Summary: create a summary for each document, embed that along with (or instead of) the document.
Hypothetical questions: create hypothetical questions that each document would be appropriate to answer, embed those along with (or instead of) the document.
Note that this also enables another method of adding embeddings - manually. This is useful because you can explicitly add questions or queries that should lead to a document being recovered, giving you more control.
Below we walk through an example. First we instantiate some documents. We will index them in an (in-memory)
Chroma
vector store using
OpenAI
embeddings, but any LangChain vector store or embeddings model will suffice.

Smaller chunks
​
Often times it can be useful to retrieve larger chunks of information, but embed smaller chunks. This allows for embeddings to capture the semantic meaning as closely as possible, but for as much context as possible to be passed downstream. Note that this is what the
ParentDocumentRetriever
does. Here we show what is going on under the hood.
We will make a distinction between the vector store, which indexes embeddings of the (sub) documents, and the document store, which houses the "parent" documents and associates them with an identifier.
import
uuid
from
langchain
.
retrievers
.
multi_vector
import
MultiVectorRetriever
store
=
InMemoryByteStore
(
)
id_key
=
"doc_id"
retriever
=
MultiVectorRetriever
(
vectorstore
=
vectorstore
,
byte_store
=
store
,
id_key
=
id_key
,
)
doc_ids
=
[
str
(
uuid
.
uuid4
(
)
)
for
_
in
docs
]
We next generate the "sub" documents by splitting the original documents. Note that we store the document identifier in the
metadata
of the corresponding
Document
object.
child_text_splitter
=
RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
(
chunk_size
=
400
)
sub_docs
=
[
]
for
i
,
doc
in
enumerate
(
docs
)
:
_id
=
doc_ids
[
i
]
_sub_docs
=
child_text_splitter
.
split_documents
(
[
doc
]
)
for
_doc
in
_sub_docs
:
_doc
.
metadata
[
id_key
]
=
_id
sub_docs
.
extend
(
_sub_docs
)
Finally, we index the documents in our vector store and document store:
retriever
.
vectorstore
.
add_documents
(
sub_docs
)
retriever
.
docstore
.
mset
(
list
(
zip
(
doc_ids
,
docs
)
)
)
The vector store alone will retrieve small chunks:
retriever
.
vectorstore
.
similarity_search
(
"justice breyer"
)
[
0
]
Document(page_content='Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. \n\nOne of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.', metadata={'doc_id': '064eca46-a4c4-4789-8e3b-583f9597e54f', 'source': 'state_of_the_union.txt'})
Whereas the retriever will return the larger parent document:
len
(
retriever
.
invoke
(
"justice breyer"
)
[
0
]
.
page_content
)
The default search type the retriever performs on the vector database is a similarity search. LangChain vector stores also support searching via
Max Marginal Relevance
. This can be controlled via the
search_type
parameter of the retriever:
from
langchain
.
retrievers
.
multi_vector
import
SearchType
retriever
.
search_type
=
SearchType
.
mmr
len
(
retriever
.
invoke
(
"justice breyer"
)
[
0
]
.
page_content
)
Associating summaries with a document for retrieval
​
A summary may be able to distill more accurately what a chunk is about, leading to better retrieval. Here we show how to create summaries, and then embed those.
We construct a simple
chain
that will receive an input
Document
object and generate a summary using a LLM.
pip install -qU "langchain[google-genai]"
import
getpass
import
os
if
not
os
.
environ
.
get
(
"GOOGLE_API_KEY"
)
:
os
.
environ
[
"GOOGLE_API_KEY"
]
=
getpass
.
getpass
(
"Enter API key for Google Gemini: "
)
from
langchain
.
chat_models
import
init_chat_model
llm
=
init_chat_model
(
"gemini-2.5-flash"
,
model_provider
=
"google_genai"
)
import
uuid
from
langchain_core
.
documents
import
Document
from
langchain_core
.
output_parsers
import
StrOutputParser
from
langchain_core
.
prompts
import
ChatPromptTemplate
chain
=
(
{
"doc"
:
lambda
x
:
x
.
page_content
}
|
ChatPromptTemplate
.
from_template
(
"Summarize the following document:\n\n{doc}"
)
|
llm
|
StrOutputParser
(
)
)
Note that we can
batch
the chain across documents:
summaries
=
chain
.
batch
(
docs
,
{
"max_concurrency"
:
5
}
)
We can then initialize a
MultiVectorRetriever
as before, indexing the summaries in our vector store, and retaining the original documents in our document store:
vectorstore
=
Chroma
(
collection_name
=
"summaries"
,
embedding_function
=
OpenAIEmbeddings
(
)
)
store
=
InMemoryByteStore
(
)
id_key
=
"doc_id"
retriever
=
MultiVectorRetriever
(
vectorstore
=
vectorstore
,
byte_store
=
store
,
id_key
=
id_key
,
)
doc_ids
=
[
str
(
uuid
.
uuid4
(
)
)
for
_
in
docs
]
summary_docs
=
[
Document
(
page_content
=
s
,
metadata
=
{
id_key
:
doc_ids
[
i
]
}
)
for
i
,
s
in
enumerate
(
summaries
)
]
retriever
.
vectorstore
.
add_documents
(
summary_docs
)
retriever
.
docstore
.
mset
(
list
(
zip
(
doc_ids
,
docs
)
)
)
Querying the vector store will return summaries:
sub_docs
=
retriever
.
vectorstore
.
similarity_search
(
"justice breyer"
)
sub_docs
[
0
]
Document(page_content="President Biden recently nominated Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve on the United States Supreme Court, emphasizing her qualifications and broad support. The President also outlined a plan to secure the border, fix the immigration system, protect women's rights, support LGBTQ+ Americans, and advance mental health services. He highlighted the importance of bipartisan unity in passing legislation, such as the Violence Against Women Act. The President also addressed supporting veterans, particularly those impacted by exposure to burn pits, and announced plans to expand benefits for veterans with respiratory cancers. Additionally, he proposed a plan to end cancer as we know it through the Cancer Moonshot initiative. President Biden expressed optimism about the future of America and emphasized the strength of the American people in overcoming challenges.", metadata={'doc_id': '84015b1b-980e-400a-94d8-cf95d7e079bd'})
Whereas the retriever will return the larger source document:
retrieved_docs
=
retriever
.
invoke
(
"justice breyer"
)
len
(
retrieved_docs
[
0
]
.
page_content
)
Hypothetical Queries
​
An LLM can also be used to generate a list of hypothetical questions that could be asked of a particular document, which might bear close semantic similarity to relevant queries in a
RAG
application. These questions can then be embedded and associated with the documents to improve retrieval.
Below, we use the
with_structured_output
method to structure the LLM output into a list of strings.
from
typing
import
List
from
pydantic
import
BaseModel
,
Field
class
HypotheticalQuestions
(
BaseModel
)
:
"""Generate hypothetical questions."""
questions
:
List
[
str
]
=
Field
(
.
.
.
,
description
=
"List of questions"
)
chain
=
(
{
"doc"
:
lambda
x
:
x
.
page_content
}
|
ChatPromptTemplate
.
from_template
(
"Generate a list of exactly 3 hypothetical questions that the below document could be used to answer:\n\n{doc}"
)
|
ChatOpenAI
(
max_retries
=
0
,
model
=
"gpt-4o"
)
.
with_structured_output
(
HypotheticalQuestions
)
|
(
lambda
x
:
x
.
questions
)
)
Invoking the chain on a single document demonstrates that it outputs a list of questions:
["What impact did the IBM 1401 have on the author's early programming experiences?",
"How did the transition from using the IBM 1401 to microcomputers influence the author's programming journey?",
"What role did Lisp play in shaping the author's understanding and approach to AI?"]
We can batch then batch the chain over all documents and assemble our vector store and document store as before:
hypothetical_questions
=
chain
.
batch
(
docs
,
{
"max_concurrency"
:
5
}
)
vectorstore
=
Chroma
(
collection_name
=
"hypo-questions"
,
embedding_function
=
OpenAIEmbeddings
(
)
)
store
=
InMemoryByteStore
(
)
id_key
=
"doc_id"
retriever
=
MultiVectorRetriever
(
vectorstore
=
vectorstore
,
byte_store
=
store
,
id_key
=
id_key
,
)
doc_ids
=
[
str
(
uuid
.
uuid4
(
)
)
for
_
in
docs
]
question_docs
=
[
]
for
i
,
question_list
in
enumerate
(
hypothetical_questions
)
:
question_docs
.
extend
(
[
Document
(
page_content
=
s
,
metadata
=
{
id_key
:
doc_ids
[
i
]
}
)
for
s
in
question_list
]
)
retriever
.
vectorstore
.
add_documents
(
question_docs
)
retriever
.
docstore
.
mset
(
list
(
zip
(
doc_ids
,
docs
)
)
)
Note that querying the underlying vector store will retrieve hypothetical questions that are semantically similar to the input query:
sub_docs
=
retriever
.
vectorstore
.
similarity_search
(
"justice breyer"
)
sub_docs
[Document(page_content='What might be the potential benefits of nominating Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the United States Supreme Court?', metadata={'doc_id': '43292b74-d1b8-4200-8a8b-ea0cb57fbcdb'}),
Document(page_content='How might the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law impact the economic competition between the U.S. and China?', metadata={'doc_id': '66174780-d00c-4166-9791-f0069846e734'}),
Document(page_content='What factors led to the creation of Y Combinator?', metadata={'doc_id': '72003c4e-4cc9-4f09-a787-0b541a65b38c'}),
Document(page_content='How did the ability to publish essays online change the landscape for writers and thinkers?', metadata={'doc_id': 'e8d2c648-f245-4bcc-b8d3-14e64a164b64'})]
And invoking the retriever will return the corresponding document:
retrieved_docs
=
retriever
.
invoke
(
"justice breyer"
)
len
(
retrieved_docs
[
0
]
.
page_content
)
