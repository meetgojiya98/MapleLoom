'answer': 'Autonomous agents are entities that can act independently to achieve specific goals or tasks without direct human intervention. These agents have the ability to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions based on their programming or learning. They can perform tasks such as planning, execution, and problem-solving autonomously.'}
