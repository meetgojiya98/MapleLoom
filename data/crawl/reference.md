Reference
Welcome to the LangGraph reference docs! These pages detail the core interfaces you will use when building with LangGraph. Each section covers a different part of the ecosystem.
Tip
If you are just getting started, see
LangGraph basics
for an introduction to the main concepts and usage patterns.
LangGraph
The core APIs for the LangGraph open source library.

Checkpointing
: Saving and restoring graph state.
Storage
: Storage backends and options.
Caching
: Caching mechanisms for performance.
Types
: Type definitions for graph components.
Config
: Configuration options.
Errors
: Error types and handling.
Constants
: Global constants.

Prebuilt components
Higher-level abstractions for common workflows, agents, and other patterns.
LangGraph Platform
Tools for deploying and connecting to the LangGraph Platform.
SDK (Python)
: Python SDK for interacting with instances of the LangGraph Server.
SDK (JS/TS)
: JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for interacting with instances of the LangGraph Server.
RemoteGraph
